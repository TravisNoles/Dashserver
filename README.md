# dashserver

Open source server manager web application, the project is currently incomplete and is not in working state currently. Working towards a first version release. Main focus on the game server part which will manage game servers and start/stop/destroy them on vultr.

Dashserver is written in Django, a Python Framework, along with HTML with the Django templating engine.

I'm estimating to have a working version by September 2020. 

# About
I created this project in order to learn more about Django, since I'm not completely familiar with it. So some of the code may be rough around the edges. Will be creating this project to learn more about Django and to create a useful application to assist with managing my servers. Hopefully others will find this useful as well.


# Feature Roadmap
* Vultr Support - Create, Stop, Destroy, Create from Snapshots
* Terraria Official Support - Start/Stop/Deploy to vultr server

# Contributions
Not currently accepting contributions until at least the first release, a lot of things may change before then. App is currently not in a functional state. Will be accepting contributions after the first release.
